# primate (IV)SO analysis
 
 This repository hosts code and data files for replicating all statistical results reported in Olivier & Martin et al. (under review), *Primate social organization evolved from a flexible pair-living ancestor*. Code will run most efficiently if all files are saved to a common directory. The `primate_ivso_prep.R` file can be used to see how the original database files (`db_R.csv`,`db_G.csv`,`db_GR.csv`) were modified for analysis, as well as how discrepancies between species names in the original database and phylogeny were identified and corrected. The `primate_ivso.R` file can then be used with the `dataR.csv`, `dataG.csv`, and `dataGR.csv` files for statistical analysis and visualization.
